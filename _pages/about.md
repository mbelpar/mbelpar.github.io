2. Parallel and Distributed Systems: Specific security and privacy challenges; performance engineering; load balancing, scheduling, allocation and provisioning and their relationship with cybersecurity; reconfigurable computing.

3. Domains and Applications with security/privacy/high performance requirements:  Future Internet (Fog, Edge, IoT, 5G); distributed simulation and Information Systems; Industrial Applications, SCM and Logistics; Information Security Management (ISM) and Critical Information Infrastructures Protection (CIIP).
